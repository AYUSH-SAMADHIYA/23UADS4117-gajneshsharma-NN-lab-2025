OBJECTIVE:

The objective of this code is to implement a perceptron-based approach to solve the XOR problem using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP). Since a single-layer perceptron cannot solve XOR due to its non-linearity, this implementation introduces an intermediate layer to achieve correct classification.


Description of the Model:

The model consists of a basic multi-layer perceptron with two hidden layer perceptrons. The network is trained using the perceptron learning rule with weight and bias updates based on error correction. The final perceptron combines the outputs of the hidden layer perceptrons to learn the XOR function.

The first layer consists of two perceptrons trained on the input data.

Their outputs form the hidden layer representation.

A final perceptron takes these hidden layer outputs and learns the XOR function.



Description of Code:

Perceptron Function: Implements a simple perceptron that calculates the weighted sum of inputs and applies a step function.

Training Function: Implements the perceptron learning algorithm with weight and bias updates based on prediction errors.

Data Preparation: Defines XOR input-output pairs.

Hidden Layer Training: Trains two separate perceptrons to extract intermediate features from input data.

Final XOR Perceptron Training: Uses hidden layer outputs as input to a final perceptron to compute the XOR function.

Evaluation: Computes predictions for all inputs and calculates accuracy.



Performance Evaluation:

The model successfully learns to classify XOR inputs.

Accuracy is calculated as the percentage of correct classifications.

Given that XOR is a simple binary problem, the expected accuracy should ideally be 100% if the model is trained correctly.



MY COMMENTS:

The approach effectively demonstrates how an XOR function can be learned using perceptrons in a multi-layer setup.

The implementation can be further improved by adding visualization for decision boundaries.

Extending this model with an activation function like sigmoid or ReLU can allow for gradient-based learning techniques (such as backpropagation in neural networks).

Using a framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch would make it easier to scale this to more complex problems.
